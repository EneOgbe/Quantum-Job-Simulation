## Recommendation

The analysis indicates that chip sales are primarily driven by purchase
frequency rather than spend per transaction, with Mainstream customers
contributing the largest share of total revenue. Older Singles/Couples represent
a core, high-value segment with stable purchasing behaviour and should remain a
priority for revenue protection through consistent product availability.

Sales also display clear seasonality, with a strong uplift in the lead-up to
December and a dip in February. Aligning promotional activity with these
seasonal patterns presents an opportunity to maximise sales impact.

While Young Singles/Couples contribute less total revenue than older segments,
they demonstrate stronger brand preferences and greater responsiveness to
brand-led strategies. Targeted promotions focused on preferred brands can be
used to drive incremental growth within this segment.

Trial analysis supports a selective rollout of successful trial strategies,
particularly in stores similar to trial stores 77 and 88. By combining targeted
trial rollouts, brand-led engagement strategies, and protection of core revenue
segments, the business can support sustainable growth over the next six months.
