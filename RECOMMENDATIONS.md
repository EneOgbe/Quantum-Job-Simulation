# Recommendations and Business Insights

## Summary of Insights
The analysis of transaction and customer data indicates that total sales are
not driven by higher spend per transaction or by differences in packet size.
Instead, sales performance is primarily influenced by transaction frequency
across customer segments.

Average spend per transaction remains highly consistent across all lifestages,
and packet size preferences show minimal variation, suggesting similar
purchasing behaviour regardless of customer demographics.

## Key Sales Drivers
- **Transaction frequency** is the primary driver of total sales.
- High-performing segments generate revenue through repeat purchasing rather
  than higher transaction values.
- Product size and spend per visit are not strong differentiators between
  customer segments.

---

## Target Customer Segments
Based on total sales and transaction volume, the following segments should be
prioritised:
- **Older Families**
- **Young Singles/Couples**
- **Retirees**

These segments consistently contribute higher sales volumes due to frequent
purchasing behaviour.

## Strategic Recommendations
1. **Focus on Repeat Purchases**
   - Implement promotions and offers that encourage frequent visits rather
     than higher spend per transaction.
   - Leverage loyalty programs to reward repeat purchasing behaviour.

2. **Target High-Frequency Segments**
   - Tailor marketing campaigns toward high-volume segments such as Older
     Families and Young Singles/Couples.
   - Use targeted messaging to reinforce habitual purchasing.

3. **Maintain Consistent Product Offering**
   - Since packet size preferences are consistent across segments, there is no
     strong evidence to support segment-specific pack size strategies.
   - Focus instead on availability, visibility, and promotion of existing
     products.

## Conclusion
By aligning marketing and promotional strategies with observed customer
behaviour, particularly transaction frequency, the business can maximise
sales performance. Targeting high-frequency customer segments with
repeat-purchase incentives is likely to deliver the greatest impact.
